Regex Tool - Project Requirements Documentation


This document outlines the technical and functional requirements for the Regex Tool project, which provides a graphical interface for regex matching and replacement operations.

1. Functional Requirements
1.1 Core Features
Regex Pattern Matching:

Allow users to input text and a regex pattern.
Display all matches for the regex pattern in the given text.
Text Replacement:

Enable users to provide a replacement string.
Replace all occurrences of the regex pattern in the text with the replacement string.
Display the modified text in the output area.
User Feedback:

Inform users when no matches are found for the provided regex.
Ensure clear and readable output in both matching and replacement scenarios.
1.2 User Interface (UI)

Input Fields:

Text field for user input text.
Text field for regex pattern.
Text field for replacement string (optional).
Buttons:

A Match button to perform regex matching.
A Replace button to perform text replacement.
Output Area:

A non-editable text area to display results (matches or modified text).

2. Technical Requirements
2.1 Development Environment
   
Programming Language: Java 8 or higher.
Framework: JavaFX for the graphical user interface.
Build Tools (Optional):
Maven or Gradle for dependency and project management.

2.2 Libraries
JavaFX SDK:

Required for building and running the GUI components.
Include javafx.controls for controls like TextField, TextArea, and Button.
Java Standard Library:

java.util.regex for regex operations (Pattern and Matcher).

3. System Requirements
3.1 Minimum System Requirements
   
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
JDK Version: Java 8 or higher.
RAM: Minimum 4GB.
Disk Space: At least 50MB for the compiled project and dependencies.

3.2 Recommended System Requirements

Operating System: Windows 10+, macOS Monterey, or Ubuntu 20.04+.
JDK Version: Java 11 or higher (with JavaFX support).
RAM: 8GB or higher for smooth performance.
Disk Space: At least 100MB for project files and additional tools.

4. Non-Functional Requirements
4.1 Usability
   
Intuitive and minimalistic user interface.
Real-time interaction and immediate feedback on button clicks.

4.2 Performance

Process regex matching and replacement efficiently, even for large input texts.
Fast response time (<500ms) for most operations.

4.3 Maintainability

Modular codebase with clear separation between the backend (RegexModule) and GUI (RegexToolUI).
Easily extendable to add new features (e.g., advanced regex options, file-based input/output).

6. Deployment Requirements
   
5.1 Development and Testing

IDE: IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or NetBeans.
Testing Frameworks:
JUnit for testing backend regex logic.
Manual testing for GUI validation.

5.2 Distribution

Provide a packaged JAR file with JavaFX dependencies or instructions for compiling and running the project.
Document required steps for running the application on different platforms.

8. Risk Management
6.1 Potential Risks
   
Regex Complexity: Users may input overly complex regex patterns that could degrade performance.
JavaFX Compatibility: Ensuring compatibility with different JavaFX versions and JDK configurations.

6.2 Mitigation Strategies

Validate user input and provide meaningful error messages.
Test the application with various JavaFX and JDK configurations.

10. Future Enhancements
    
Add support for advanced regex options (e.g., flags like case-insensitivity).
Enable file upload and processing.
Provide syntax highlighting for regex patterns.
Add localization support for multiple languages.
